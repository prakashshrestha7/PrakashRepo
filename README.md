- MySQL Workbench

## Installing

## Running the Tests
## Breakdown of Tests
The code includes the following functionalities:
Loading Libraries: Imports necessary libraries, including pandas and matplotlib.
Histogram Plot function: Defines a function to plot a histogram of channel type distribution.
Data Slicing Function: Defines a function to slice the DataFrame and plot the distribution of channel types within the sliced data.
Data Export to CSV function: Defines a function to export data to a CSV file.
Data Loading: Loads the YouTube dataset from a CSV file, handling encoding issues.
Data Processing: Slices the dataset to extract the top 1000 records and plot their channel type distribution.
Data Export: Exports the top 1000 records to a CSV file.
